# Version info for python script mensaman.py
#
# starting with version: 0.2.3

changes in version 0.5.0:
- graphical user interface was added
   using zenity and kdialog two guis were added
   first gui lets the user specify which days should
   be displayed. the gui preselects the current date
   if it is part of the current week.
   after preparing the selected days, the original
   mensaman.py script is called and its output is
   piped to be stored.
   Another window is than used to display the gather
   information
- encoding was added to output
   text was only decoded using ISO-8859-1 definition
   this result in a problem, when pipeing the output
   to applictions not capable of the required encoding
   feature.
   therefore after decoding, the text is now encoded
   again using utf-8
- nameing system changed
   because of using github, there will no longer be a
   mensaman_X.X.X.py file. instead there is only one
   executable python file. therefore the system link is
   also removed and the main executable has changed
   to the same name as the previous link, so that
   all previously set commands to that link are still going
   to work with the new naming convetion
- new command line argument '--version'
   prints program name and current version, than exits with return 0
- help information modified
   new command descriptions were added

changes in version 0.3.2:

  alias mathing was casing an error because it could
  return an list or an integer
  both cases are now treated separatly and should no
  longer cause any problems - thanks to Alex for finding the bug

changes in version 0.3.1:
- alias matching was implemented
  when an argument of list ['week','woche'] is given
  the whole week will be printed
   Internally week is first translated into a list of
